I would have to use Foursquare to get detailed data from most businesses in the area. This would be fairly interesting to someone trying to start a new business in the area since there is many other shops and restaurants in the area. The location would be something they would need to be aware of or the business will probably not do well because of all the competition. I will plot a map and find information about the busiest part of the neighborhood."
